        <p>My name is Tamara Kaka and I enjoy listening to music, watching documentaries and just learning
            as a whole. I occasionally cook when I have the time but not because I enjoy eating but I love
            the process of learning what flavours work together, how you can combine ingredients in different
            ways to bring about varying tastes and textures. When I find a new recipe I want to learn, I 
            repeat it over and over until I perfect it--and my family get to enjoy the byproduct of my
            obsession. I am a very quiet person around new people but I am still able to articulate myself
            if need be.

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am currently not in school as I graduated from high school in May this year (2024) and I am
            awaiting a university admission so in the meantime, I am taking on this software development
            course. So my highest level of education is a high-school diploma. In terms of coding experience,
            I did learn HTML, CSS and some python at school but the with the time off I forgot most of it. I
            want to learn programming because I believe it can be a useful skill to apply to my college
            degree and across various other realms.

        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <p> In terms of technical skills at the moment I am limited to HTML and CSS. Some non-technical
            skills I possess are, one, I do consider myself a good problem-solver or at least, I refuse
            to quit on something until it is resolved. I love learning as mentioned before, I will
            look up something and spend hours reading about how it works to make sure I know how to 
            use it correctly. Thirdly, I speak a little French, I haven't practiced that much since I left
            school but in my prime I was up to a B2 level.

        <p>This is just a static pet-shop web page I made using just HTML though it's exhausted a lot
            of the features HTML has to offer.</p>

        <p>This portfolio is another project made using HTML and CSS which is one step-up from the pet-shop
            project.</p>
